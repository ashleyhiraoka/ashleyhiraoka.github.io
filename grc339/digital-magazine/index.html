                                <p>
                                Blame William Shakespeare. Early in lockdown, it became an adage—then a joke, then a cliché—that since he wrote King Lear during the plague, we could, too, channel our isolation into creative energy. But some people did actually create some life-changing feats of creativity during lockdown, including 22-year-old Tega Akinola. In early 2020, the British designer, then a sports psychology student, headed to her parents’ home in the Midlands to quarantine. Cleaning out her bedroom, she came across a bag of broken cables. Before she threw it out, the USB caught her eye. “It reminded me of the buckle on a heel,” she says. “I bought a heel and literally glued the cables on and it took off from there.”

                                Frank Ayzenberg’s name for his furniture design company “Playground Studio” feels just right for his designs. The 22-year-old New York-based furniture designer creates pieces imbued with youthful energy: an enameled steel table that sits on orange cone legs, a sofa that is crafted from stacked glass blocks, commonly used in bathrooms, topped with upholstered velvet corduroy cushions.

                                    The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) published a report on Weaving a Better Future, which examines rebuilding a more sustainable fashion industry after COVID-19.

But during lockdown I was just forced in my room to deal with things that I’ve been avoiding my entire life.

                                    This collection is inspired from the waste that the fashion industry creates. Shreds, second-hand clothes are upcycled and given a new preciosity. The silhouette of the outfits are inspired from 17th century royal garments, in contrast with today’s fast fashion items.

                                    The phrase “leap of faith” must be indelibly imprinted on the mind of just about every young designer who has decided to go it alone with their own label today.
