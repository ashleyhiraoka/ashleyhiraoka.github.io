                                Blame William Shakespeare. Early in lockdown, it became an adage—then a joke, then a cliché—that since he wrote King Lear during the plague, we could, too, channel our isolation into creative energy. But some people did actually create some life-changing feats of creativity during lockdown, including 22-year-old Tega Akinola.

                                Frank Ayzenberg’s name for his furniture design company “Playground Studio” feels just right for his designs. The 22-year-old New York-based furniture designer creates pieces imbued with youthful energy.

                                    Valentina Li is quick to correct me when I refer to her as a makeup artist, telling me that “face painter” feels more appropriate to her at this phase of her career. “ ‘Artist’ is too big for me at this moment,” she says humbly.
