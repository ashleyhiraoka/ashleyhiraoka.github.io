                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>We are the owners of Better Beans. We spent over 10 years dreaming, planning, learning and working in all things coffee with the hope that someday we would start a shop of our own. In January of 2014, we launched Better Beans on Garden Street in Downtown San Luis Obispo. A year later, we rolled up the doors to our roasting company, HoneyCo Coffee Roasters. In August of 2016, we opened our second Better Beans location on Foothill Boulevard near Cal Poly. We now have over 40 wonderful employees, and love that you have made Scout one of the most sought after destinations on the Central Coast. Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible.</p>
